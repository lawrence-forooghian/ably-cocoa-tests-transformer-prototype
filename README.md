# ably-cocoa-tests-transformer prototype

A prototype for a tool for converting ably-cocoa’s QuickSpec tests to normal XCTestCase subclasses. See https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/issues/1201.

The code here is probably awful and shouldn’t be used as an example of how to do anything. It does do what we want it to, though.

Usage:

```
swift run ably-cocoa-tests-linter /Users/lawrence/code/ably/ably-cocoa/Spec/
```

Run with the `--help` flag for information on accepted flags.
